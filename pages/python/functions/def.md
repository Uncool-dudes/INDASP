```python{*|1|2}
def function_name( arguments ):
    # stuff...
    return modified_arguments
```
```python
function_name = lambda arguments : something(arguments)
```
````

These functions are also called anonymous functions as the function name is based off a variable assignment and not truly a function name like `def`.

    - Functions must have a name should be in snake case(stylistic).
    - There are some naming conventions we will talk about regarding function arguments.
- [click] There is no recommendation regarding function body length though this might depend on organizational guidelines
